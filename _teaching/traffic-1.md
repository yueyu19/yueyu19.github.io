Do you know how to find the shortest path in a directed network by solving a linear program? Find out more in this post.

# Prerequisite

[Linear program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) and its optimality conditions.

# Directed networks

A directed network is defined by a set of nodes $\mathcal{N}=\\{1, 2, \ldots, n_l\\}$ and a set of links $\mathcal{L}=\\{1, 2, \ldots, n_l\\}$. Each link $k$ is defined by a pair of ordered distinct nodes $(i, j)$, where node $i$ is known as the <em>tail</em> of link $k$, and node $j$ is the known as the <em>head</em> of the link.
