I am a postdoc at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin. My advisor is [Professor Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu). I obtained my PhD degree from Univsersity of Washington. My PhD advisor is [Professor Behcet Acikmese](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/behcet-acikmese). My research aims to build autonomous systems in fast-changing, adverserial, and competitive environments. To this end, I develop theoretical and computational methods by combining tools from various fields, including optimization, control, and game theory.
