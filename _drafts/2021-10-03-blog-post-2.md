Minimization of a function subject to constraints can be a difficult optimization problem. But some of these problems are easier than the others.
In this post, we will discuss a special class of constrained optimization, the projection onto structured convex sets.
These projections can be computed using simple and elegant formulas, and provides bulding blocks for many advanced optimization methods.
