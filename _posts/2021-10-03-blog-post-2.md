Minimization of a function subject to constraints can be a difficult optimization problem. But some of these problems are easier than the others.
In this post, we will discuss a special class of constrained optimization, the projection onto structured convex sets.
These projections can be computed using simple and elegant formulas, and provides bulding blocks for many advanced constrained optimization methods.

# What is projection

Given a set $\mathbb{D}$ and a point $x$, a projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ is a point in set $\mathbb{D}$ that is closest to $x$ in terms of Euclidean distance (the $\ell_2$ norm). If set $\mathbb{D}$ is closed and convex, such projection is unique. We denote the projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ as $pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]$, defined mathematically as follows:

$$\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]=\underset{y\in\mathbb{D}}{\mbox{argmin}}\enskip ||x-y||$$

# Why is projection useful

Projection is a building block for projected gradient method, and many other methods for constrained optimization. 

Consider the minimization of a differentiable convex function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ over a closed convex set $\mathbb{D}$. One of the most basic and powerful method for such minimization is the <em>projection gradient method<em>, which computes a sequence of estimate of the optimizer, $x^1, x^2, \ldots$, recursively as follows:
  
  $$x^{k+1}=\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x^k-\alpha \nabla f(x^k)],$$
  
where $\alpha$ is a known positive scalar for step size.
  
The projection is also used in many advanced constrained optimization methods, including the [Douglas-Rachford splitting method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.1090.pdf) and [Proportional-integral projected gradient method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf).
 
# How to compute a projection
  
  In general, computing the projection onto set $\mathbb{D}$ can be non-trivial. For example, if $\mathbb{D}$ is a [convex polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope), the computing the projection onto $\mathbb{D}$ is a [linear complementarity problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_complementarity_problem), which requires an iterative method itself.
  
  Fortunately, when set $\mathbb{D}$ has some particular structure, we can compute the projection onto $\mathbb{D}$ using very simple formulas, as we will show next.
