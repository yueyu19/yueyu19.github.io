Minimization of a function subject to constraints can be a difficult optimization problem. But some of these problems are easier than the others.
In this post, we will discuss a special class of constrained optimization, the projection onto structured convex sets.
These projections can be computed using simple and elegant formulas, and provide bulding blocks for many constrained optimization methods.

# What is projection

Given a set $\mathbb{D}$ and a point $x$, a projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ is a point in set $\mathbb{D}$ that is closest to $x$ in terms of Euclidean distance. If set $\mathbb{D}$ is closed and convex, such projection is unique. We denote the projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ as $pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]$, defined mathematically as follows:

$$\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]=\underset{y\in\mathbb{D}}{\mbox{argmin}}\,\, ||x-y||,$$

where
$$||\cdot||$$
denotes the $\ell_2$-norm.

# Why is projection useful

Projection is a building block for projected gradient method, and many other methods for constrained optimization. 

Consider the minimization of a differentiable convex function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ over a closed convex set $\mathbb{D}$. One of the most basic and powerful method for such minimization is the <em>projection gradient method<em>, which computes a sequence of estimate of the optimizer, $x^1, x^2, \ldots$, recursively as follows:
  
  $$x^{k+1}=\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x^k-\alpha \nabla f(x^k)],$$
  
where $\alpha$ is a known positive scalar for step size.
  
The projection is also used in many advanced constrained optimization methods, including the [Douglas-Rachford splitting method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.1090.pdf) and [Proportional-integral projected gradient method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf).
 
# How to compute a projection
  
  In general, computing the projection onto set $\mathbb{D}$ can be non-trivial. For example, if $\mathbb{D}$ is a [convex polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope), the computing the projection onto $\mathbb{D}$ is a [linear complementarity problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_complementarity_problem), which requires an iterative method itself.
  
## Examples of simple sets
  
  Fortunately, when set $\mathbb{D}$ has some particular structure, we can compute the projection onto $\mathbb{D}$ using very simple formulas, as we will show.
  
### Box
  
  Consider the following set $\mathbb{D}$
  
  $$ \mathbb{D}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^n|l\leq y\leq u\},$$
  
  where $l, u\in\mathbb{R}^n$ are known lower and upper bounds.
  
  The projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ is given by
  
  $$\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]=\min\{\max\{x, l\}, u\}.$$
  
  An important special case of the box constraint set is the <em>nonnegative orthant<em>, where 
  
  $$\mathbb{D}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^n| y\geq 0\}.$$
  
  In this case, the projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ becomes
  
  $$\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]=\max\{x, 0\}.$$
  
### Ball
  
  Consider the following set $\mathbb{D}$
  
  $$ \mathbb{D}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^n| ||y||\leq \rho\},$$
  
  where $\rho\in\mathbb{R}$ is a known nonnegative radius.
  
  The projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ is given by
  
  $$\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]=\frac{\rho}{\max\{||x||, \rho\}}x$$ 
  
### Cylinder
  
  Consider the following set $\mathbb{D}$
  
  $$ \mathbb{D}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^n| -\eta\leq \langle e, y\rangle\leq \eta, ||y-\langle e, y\rangle e||\leq \rho\},$$

where $e\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with
$$||e||=1$$
, $\eta, \rho\in\mathbb{R}$ are positive scalars. Here vector $e$ determines the orientation of the cylinder, $\eta$ and $\rho$ are the half-length and radius of the cylinder, respectively.
  
  The projection onto set $\mathbb{D}$ can be computed in two steps. In the first step, we let
  
  $$ z=\begin{cases}
  x, & \text{if } -\eta\leq \langle e, x\rangle\leq \eta,\\
  x-(\langle e, x\rangle-\eta)e, & \text{if } \langle e, x\rangle>1,\\
  x-(\langle e, x\rangle+\eta)e, \text{if } \langle e, x\rangle<-1.
  \end{cases}$$
  
  In the second step, given vector $z$ computed in the first step, the projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ is given by
                                                                    
  $$\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]=\begin{cases}
  x, & \text{if } ||x-\langle e, x\rangle e||\leq \rho,\\
  \langle e, x\rangle e+\frac{\rho(x-\langle e, x\rangle e)}{||x-\langle e, x\rangle e||}, & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases} $$
                                                                      
### Icecream cone
   Consider the following set $\mathbb{D}$
  
  $$ \mathbb{D}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^n| -\eta\leq \langle e, y\rangle\leq \eta, ||y-\langle e, y\rangle e||\leq \rho\},$$

where $e\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with
  
### Intersection of an icecream cone and a ball 
  Consider the following set $\mathbb{D}$
  
  $$ \mathbb{D}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^n| -\eta\leq \langle e, y\rangle\leq \eta, ||y-\langle e, y\rangle e||\leq \rho\},$$

where $e\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with
