Minimization of a function subject to constraints can be a difficult optimization problem. But some of these problems are easier than the others.
In this post, we will discuss a special class of constrained optimization, the projection onto structured convex sets.
These projections can be computed using simple and elegant formulas, and provides bulding blocks for many advanced constrained optimization methods.

# What is projection

Given a set $\mathbb{D}$ and a point $x$, a projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ is a point in set $\mathbb{D}$ that is closest to $x$ in terms of Euclidean distance (the $\ell_2$ norm). If set $\mathbb{D}$ is closed and convex, such projection is unique. We denote the projection of $x$ onto set $\mathbb{D}$ as $pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]$, defined mathematically as follows:

$$\pi_{\mathbb{D}}[x]=\underset{y\in\mathbb{D}}\mbox{argmin}\enskip ||x-y||$$
