Do you remeber the mass-spring-damper model you learned in high-school physics classes? Based on this model, we developed a novel method for constrained optimization with better convergence rates. Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf)! 

# Key idea 1: Mass-spring-damper

Imagine you have two mass blocks connected by a spring and a damper. Then physics tells us that the relative velocity between the two mass blocks will eventually converge to zero, otherwise the damper will dissipate the energy in the system indefinitely.

Inspired by this physics model, we develope a novel method for convex optimization with conic constraints. By mimicking the dynamics of the mass-spring-damper system, our method ensures the constraint violation converge to zero (just like the relative velocity) and the optimal value is attained. 

We used similar ideas in our previous work on [distributed optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06273.pdf).

# Key idea 2: Moreau decomposition

Unlike our previous work, the new method can handle **any** convex conic constraints, thanks to [Moreau's decomposition theorem](https://www.convexoptimization.com/wikimization/index.php/Moreau%27s_decomposition_theorem). Moreau's decomposition generalizes the orthogonal decomposition in linear algebra, see the figure on the right. Due to Moreau's decomposition, we can treat conic constraints the same way we treat linear equality constraints in [our previous work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06980.pdf).   

# Application example

We demonstrate our method using the path-planning problem based on a 3DoF quadrotor model. We first approximate the collision avoidance constraints using linearization, then solve the resulting convex conic optimization problem using the new method.
