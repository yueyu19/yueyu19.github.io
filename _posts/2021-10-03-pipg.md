Do you remeber the mass-spring-damper model you learned in high-school physics classes? Based on this model, we developed a new method for constrained optimization that has better convergence rates. Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf)! 

# Key ideas

Our work is based on the following two key ideas.

## Mass-spring-damper

Imagine you have two discrete mass nodes connected by a spring and a damper. Classical physics tells us that the relative velocity between the two discrete mass nodes will eventually converge to zero, otherwise the damper would indefinitely dissipate energy from the system.

Inspired by this physics model, we develope a novel method for convex optimization with conic constraints. By mimicking the dynamics of the mass-spring-damper system, our method ensures the constraint violation converge to zero (just like the relative velocity) and certain convex objective function is minimized.

We used similar ideas in our previous work on [distributed optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06273.pdf).

## Moreau decomposition

[Moreau's decomposition](https://www.convexoptimization.com/wikimization/index.php/Moreau%27s_decomposition_theorem) is a generalization of the orthogonal decomposition in linear algebra, see the figure on the right. Thanks to Moreau's decomposition, we can treat conic constraints the same way we treat linear equality constraints in [our previous work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06980.pdf). As a result, the new method can handle **any** convex conic constraints.  

# Application

We demonstrate the application of the new method using examples from optimal control. In particular, we consider the path-planning problem for a quadrotor with obstacle avoidance constraints. We first approximate the obstacle avoidance constraints via linearization, then solve the resulting convex optimization problem using the new method.
