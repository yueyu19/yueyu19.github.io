Do you remeber the mass-spring-damper model you learned in high-school or college physics classes? Based on this model, we developed a novel method for constrained optimization with better convergence rates. Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf)! 

# Key ideas

## Mass-spring-damper and energy dissipation

Imagine you have two mass blocks connected by a spring and a damper, together placed on a surface with no fraction. Then physics tells us: the relative velocity between the two mass blocks will eventually converge to zero, otherwise the damper will continue to dissipate energy from the system.

Inspired by the above thought experiment, we develope a novel method for convex optimization with conic constraints. By mimicking the dynamics of the mass-spring-damper model, our method ensures the constraint violation converge to zero (just like the relative velocity). 

We used similar ideas in our previous work on [distributed optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06273.pdf) and [model predictive control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06980.pdf).

## Moreau decomposition

Unlike our previous work that only consider linear equality cnstraints, our current method can handle any convex conic constraints. The idea behind this extension is [Moreau's decomposition theorem](https://www.convexoptimization.com/wikimization/index.php/Moreau%27s_decomposition_theorem), which allows our method to monitor the violation of conic constraints the same way we monitor the violation of linear equality constraints.   

# Numerical examples

We demonstrate our method using the path-planning problem based on a 3DoF quadrotor model. We first approximate the collision avoidance constraints using linearization, the solve the resulting convex conic optimization problem using the proposed method, and compared its performance against existing methods.
