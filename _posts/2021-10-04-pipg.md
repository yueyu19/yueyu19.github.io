Do you remeber the mass-spring-damper model you learned in high-school or college physics classes? Based on this model, we developed a novel method for constrained optimization with better convergence rates. Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf)!

Imagine you have two mass blocks connected by a spring and a damper, together placed on a surface with no fraction. Then physics tells us: the velocity of the two mass blocks will eventually converge to zero, otherwise the damper will continue to dissipate energy from the system.
