When you solve a constrained optimization problem, have you wondered whether the problem has a solution at all? And if so, how can you tell? We propose a novel method to answer this question that, for the first time, avoids expensive matrix inverse computation! Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf)! 

# Key ideas

## Separating hyperplane

A constrained optimization is infeasible if its constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously. A proof of infeasibility is a <em>separting hyperplane</em> that shows two subsets of the constraints cannot be satisfied at the same time. We showed that [the method inspired by mass-spring-damper](/_posts/2021-10-03-pipg) can generate such separating hyperplane whenever possible. Further, it can also detects whether an optimization has finite optimal value.
