When you solve a constrained optimization problem, have you wondered whether the problem has a solution at all? And if so, how can you tell? We propose a novel method to answer this question that, for the first time, avoids expensive matrix inverse computation! Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf)! 

# Key ideas

## Separating hyperplane

A constrained optimization is infeasible if its constraints cannot be satisfied. A proof of infeasibility is a <em>separting hyperplane</em> that shows two subsets of the constraints cannot be satisfied at the same time. We showed that [an optimization method inspired by mass-spring-damper](/_posts/2021-10-03-pipg) can generate such separating hyperplane whenever possible. Further, it can also determine whether an optimization has finite optimal value.

Unlike [previous work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-019-01575-y), the proposed method does not compute matrix inverse, making it suitable for large-scale applications!

## Averaged operator

The key consept in our work is averaged operator, which is the weighted average of the identity map and an nonexpansive map (e.g., an rotation map $R$, see the figure on the right). We showed that the proposed method is the fixed point iteration of an averaged operator. As a result, the difference between consecutive iterates always converge to a limit, and this limit either proves optimality or infeasibility.

# Numerical examples

We demonstrate our results using the following two optimal control problems.

## Minimum-time landing

We consider the problem of finding the minimum amount of time need to land a quadrotor on a charging station. We showed that the probelm is equivalent to minimizing a [quasiconvex function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiconvex_function), and the minimum-time can be computed by systematically reducing the time of flight.



## Path-planning using mixed-integer optimization

We consider a path-planning problem in a non-convex area, where the non-convexity is encoded as binary variables. Using infeasibility detection, we significantly reduce the complexity of the problem by eliminating some of the binary variables.
