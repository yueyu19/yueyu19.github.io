When you solve a constrained optimization problem, have you wondered whether the problem has a solution at all? And if so, how can you tell? We propose a novel method to answer this question that, for the first time, avoids expensive matrix inverse computation! Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf)!
