If I give you an optimization problem with thousands of constraints, can you tell me whether these constraints can be satisfied? We propose a new method to answer this question that, for the first time, avoids expensive matrix inverse computation. Find out more in this post and [our new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02756.pdf)! 

# Key ideas

Our work is based on the following two key ideas.

## Separating hyperplane

Given a constrained optimization, a proof of infeasibility is a <em>separting hyperplane</em> that shows two subsets of the constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously. We showed that [a new method inspired by mass-spring-damper model](https://yueyu19.github.io/posts/2012/08/pipg/) can generate such separating hyperplane whenever possible. Furthermore, it can also determine whether an optimization problem has infinite optimal value.

Unlike [previous work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-019-01575-y), the new method does not compute matrix inverse, making it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications.

## Averaged operator

We prove the correctness of the new method using the theory of <em>averaged operator</em>, which is the weighted average of the identity map and an nonexpansive map (e.g., an rotation map $R$, see the figure on the right). We showed that the new method is the fixed point iteration of an averaged operator. As a result, the difference between its consecutive iterates always converges to a limit, and this limit proves either optimality or infeasibility.

# Application

We demonstrate the application of the new method using the following examples in optimal control.

## Minimum-time landing

We consider the problem of finding the minimum amount of time needed to land a quadrotor on a charging station. We showed that the probelm is equivalent to minimizing a [quasiconvex function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiconvex_function), and the minimum-time can be computed by systematically reducing the time of flight.

## Path-planning using mixed-integer optimization

We consider a path-planning problem in a L-shaped corridor using mixed-integer optimization. Using infeasibility detection, we significantly reduce the problem complexity by reducing the number of integer variables.
