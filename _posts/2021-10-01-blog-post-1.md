Do you remeber the law of cosines from your high-school math classes? Did you know that it is an incredibly useful technique in proving the convergence of almost all of the first-order convex optimization methods? Find out more in this post.

Where it all started
======

You probably have seen the [low of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines) before, likely in high school. Given a triangle, the law of cosines gives an identity between the cosine of one of the three angles and the length of the three sides, as shown by the image on the right.
